**Substrate Showcase:**
* [GGX Chain](https://github.com/ggxchain/ggxnode) - GGX is an Interchain consensus platform for communication, asset transfer, swap and modularity.
* The GGx platform has a programmable layer 0 communications protocol, with the ability to transfer assets between the Ethereum ecosystem with the rapidly emerging Bitcoin ecosystem, with Cosmos and other chains forthcoming.
* GGx chain has a consensus of Bitcoin & Ethereum Light clients, which allow our chain to share the security of Bitcoin & Ethereum and our node operators can make additional revenue streams by message relaying business and DeFi orchestration on behalf of apps that are deployed on GGx. Node operators can extend support by setting up additional chain connectors of trustless relayers for IBC (Cosmos), Tron, Polygon, etc
* First use case of GGx is an onchain trustless orderbook like spot exchange (GGEx) that will leverage the ability to do cross chain message relaying between Bitcoin, Ethereum & IBC (Cosmos) to do atomic swaps like RFQs. This exchange will allow to trade BTC against USDC (ERC-20) or any other asset on one of selected chains with few seconds in finality and without slippage, MEV or impermanent loss risks that AMM DEXes typically have.
