# Delivery Partners Directory

Welcome to the Polkadot ecosystem **Delivery Partners Program** directory! 

This repository serves as a resource to help you **find expert engineering partners capable of building with the Polkadot SDK or setting up the infrastructure to run your chain**. Whether you're looking to develop innovative blockchain solutions, create custom tools, or simply need engineering support, the companies listed in this directory are capable of assisting you.

## Purpose of the Directory

The directory provides a comprehensive overview of our Delivery Partners, including:

* **Member Profiles:** High level overview about each partner, including areas of expertise, background, and experience with the Polkadot SDK.
* **Capabilities:** A summary of the technical skills, solutions, and services that each partner can provide, ranging from blockchain development to consultation, auditing, and maintenance.
* **Pitch Decks:** Visual presentations showcasing the partnerâ€™s unique value propositions, past projects, and how they can help bring your ideas on Polkadot to life.

## Types of Delivery Partners

Delivery Partners are categorized into three key types to meet the different stages of building on Polkadot:

1. **Substrate Runtime Development:**
Partners specializing in runtime development focus on the core logic of your blockchain, including custom pallets and features that run on Polkadot. They can assist with creating custom blockchains, modifying existing runtimes, and handling the deeper technical aspects of blockchain architecture.

1. **Frontend Development (UI/UX Design and Development):**
These partners focus on the user experience and interface design for blockchain applications. Whether you're building a blockchain explorer, dApps, or other user-facing products, these teams provide expertise in both UI/UX design and development. They help ensure that your product is intuitive, visually appealing, and functional.

1. **Infrastructure/DevOps:**
Partners in this category provide the necessary infrastructure for running and maintaining a blockchain network. They specialize in setting up and managing nodes, whether you're deploying validator or collator nodes. Their services include ensuring uptime, scalability, and security for your blockchain, while also implementing automation and monitoring tools to keep your network running smoothly.

These three categories of delivery partners offer a comprehensive approach to building a blockchain solution on Polkadot, covering everything from the backend runtime development to the frontend experience, and ensuring your infrastructure is reliable and secure.
